# About
Software Engineer specializing in backend systems and distributed architecture, primarily in Rust.
I work across the full lifecycle of complex systems, from initial architecture and service design
through implementation, deployment, and operations. My experience spans algorithmic trading infrastructure,
real-time data platforms, and blockchain protocol development. Most of my backend work is in Rust,
where I've built event-driven microservice platforms using Kafka, gRPC, and WebSocket for real-time delivery,
designed data ingestion pipelines with rate limiting and archival strategies, and developed custom blockchain
runtimes on Polkadot SDK with full API surfaces in REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.On the infrastructure side,
I work with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. I've designed systems that moved from monolithic
architectures to distributed platforms, and I'm comfortable making the tradeoff decisions that come with scaling,
service boundaries, messaging patterns, caching layers, and deployment strategies.
I also build cross-platform applications when the product calls for it, using React Native across iOS, Android, and web.
Beyond individual contribution, I've led small engineering teams, owned technical direction for multi-service platforms,
and defined architecture for AI-integrated data pipelines.
